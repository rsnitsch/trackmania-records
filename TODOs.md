# TODOs

- Server: Display a meaningful message if no track set is complete so the users understand
  why nothing is displayed (complete = a record is known for each of the 25 tracks)
- Server: Properly sort the displayed track sets by year and season.
- Server: Make it easy to user the ?user= feature
